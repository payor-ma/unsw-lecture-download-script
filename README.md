# unsw-lecture-download-script
Some thrown together js that will run on pre-recorded lectures hosted on **BbCollab** and **Moodle**.  It opens the raw video file in a new tab using your auth, so you can download the video, play at different speeds, etc.

This script runs on **TamperMonkey** (or GreaseMonkey or equivalent plugin) for your browser.  Install this plugin for your browser.  After that's done, the simplest way to set up the script is to navigate to the addons' dashboard, click on the option along the lines of "create a new script", and copy paste the script from this repository into the editor.  Alternatively, the more proper way would be to download the script from here, and use the option along the lines of "upload a local script".
